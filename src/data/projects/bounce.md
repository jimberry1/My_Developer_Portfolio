This is project created a multimedia cross-platform tool for sharing music. A large group of people took up the app and use it regularly to make others aware of what new music they've found or mixes they have made. The project was primarily developed in React JS and relies on a Firebase back end server to store user data and handle requests. The design and layout was created solely by me.
