# My Developer portfolio

As a software developer feels immoral not to have a developer portfolio to centralise your ideas and showcase your experience. Whilst the profile doesn't fully encapsulate my projects or my passions, it's a good start in showcasing what I have to offer and I will aim to keep the site updated with new information as and when I feel it appropriate. I decided that I would take the opportunity to learn Gatsby whilst this page. I had heard about the benefits of static site generators for a while so I was happy to finally get the chance to create a site using it.
